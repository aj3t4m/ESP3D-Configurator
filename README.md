# ESP3D-Configurator

Project of Web Configurator to generate ESP3D configuration file.

Using github-action / issues form bring too many constraints with not really great user experience,  so will go for
 a standalone html file instead, and it will be hosted in github static page area
It will use same element as ESP3D-WebUI to save time:
* nodejs
* webpack
* spectre.css
* Preact

It should be something similar to https://www.repetier.com/firmware/v100/index.php but in one static page so it should work online hosted by github or offline on user PC 

Status : early alpha    

The configurator is available [here](https://luc-github.github.io/)
