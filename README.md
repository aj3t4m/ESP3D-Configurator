# ESP3D-Configurator

Test Project to use Github action and issue form template as ESP3D configuator.

Using github-action / issues form bring too many constraints with not really great user experience,  so will to a standalone htm instead and it will be hosted in github static page area
I will use same element as webUI to save time:
* nodejs
* webpack
* spectre.css
* Preact

It will be something similar to https://www.repetier.com/firmware/v100/index.php but in one static page so it should work online hosted by github or offline on user PC
