# ESP3D-Configurator

Project of Web Configurator to generate ESP3D configuration file.

Using github-action / issues form bring too many constraints with not really great user experience, so I went for
a standalone html file instead, and it is hosted in github static page area
It use same element as ESP3D-WebUI to save development time (yeah I am super lazy...):

-   nodejs
-   webpack
-   spectre.css
-   Preact

It should be something similar to https://www.repetier.com/firmware/v100/index.php but in one static page so it should work online hosted by github or offline on user PC

Status : Beta

The configurator is available [here](https://luc-github.github.io/)
